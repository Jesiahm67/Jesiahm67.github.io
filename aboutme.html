    <h3 class="color">Welcome To My About Me Page</h3>

    <p>Hello my name is Jesiah and I am currently a 12th grade student and I am in a program called the Brooklyn Steam Center.
    I am in love with many games on many consoles like Playstation, Xbox and Nintendo. I loved video games ever since I was seven when my dad introduced me to classic super mario bros, then I completed that then super mario bros 2, 3, 4 and yoshi's island. It was known that I can master multiple games to my likings and I played games like there was no tomorrow. Other than games I was great with school work and I would always try to get my homework done before the deadline hit.I have 19.5 hours of work experience and I am open to more opportunities in the future.
    In my last year at steam I have learned how to properly use html, CSS and JavaScript and I am currently learning how to use backend development like node.js and the terminal so I can be a Full stack developer. I am also learning how to use python this year for my python certification and I am excited to learn how to code and make my own AI.</p>
