    <p>Hello my name is jesiah and I am currently a 11th grade student and I am in a program called steam. I am in love with many games on many consoles like playstation, xbox and nintendo. I loved games ever since I was seven when my dad introduced me to classic super mario bros, then I completed that then super mario bros 2, 3, 4 and yoshi's island. It was known that I can master multiple games to my likings and I played games like there was no tomorrow. Other than games I was great with school work and I would always try to get my homework done before the deadline hit.</p>
